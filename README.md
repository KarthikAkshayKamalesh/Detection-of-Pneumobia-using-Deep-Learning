## Description of the project
Pneumonia is an infectious and fatal respiratory infection caused by bacteria, fungus, or viruses that infect the human lung air sacs and fill them with fluid or pus. Pneumonia is one of the main reasons for death among children and the elderly in the world. Chest X-rays are the most systematic approach for diagnosing pneumonia, and the results must be evaluated by a medical professional.The inconvenient technique of detecting pneumonia resulted in the death of a person owing to incorrect diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of computer technology, it is now feasible to build an autonomous system for detecting pneumonia and treating the disease, especially if the patient is in a remote region with limited medical resources. So, this is the primary motivation behind this project.

In this project, we are going to detect the Pneumonia using Deep Learning Algorithms. There are many ways to detect Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray images, but here we are going to compare different algorithms test accuracy and choose the best algorithm for detecting Pneumonia. After choosing the best algorithm from the pretrained ones, we will develop a Webapp to view the result of it using Flask and HTML.The Dataset that we used in this project is from the open source Kaggle.The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou.

## Installation

1. Download the Dataset from the link given below. This is a open source dataset from Kaggle.
   https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
2. Download and Install Git on your computer. Click the link below to download the Git.  The installation process is straightforward and brings you through a lot of boilerplate    information. The one thing you want to be careful with is that you allow Git to be used from the command line.
   https://git-scm.com/download/
3. Open the Command Prompt (on Windows) or whichever terminal you happen to be using on your computer.
4. In the terminal, navigate to the location in which you would like to store the repo. You can do so by typing the following command:
   $ cd <directory>
   For example:
   $ cd C:/Users/karth/Desktop
5. Copy and Paste the following as given below:
   ```
   $ git clone "https://github.com/KarthikAkshayKamalesh/Detection-of-Pneumobia-using-Deep-Learning.git"
   ```
6. Give the process a few moments to complete.As a matter of good practice, check to make sure that the repository is on your machine. To do so, navigate to the directory in        which it was stored.

## Usage
   
1. Open app.py file in any text editor and then change it to your working directory. You need to change the directory for these 2 places mentioned below:
   <p align="left"><img height="350" width="700" src="Assests/app.png"></p>
2. Open Command Prompt, change your directory to the location of app.py file in your computer.
   For ex:
   cd C:\Users\karth\Desktop\project\PD
3. Run the app.py file in the terminal. For this use the following command below:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   <p align="left"><img height="350" width="700" src="Assests/imageone.png"></p>
4. Next step is to copy the URL and paste it in the google URL bar or You can also copy and paste the link given below to open the webapp.
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   <p align="left"><img height="350" width="700" src="Assests/imagetwo.png"></p>
5. Now click on "Choose File" button and select chest image to predict the outcome. After selecting, Click "Predict" button to display the result of the outcome.

## Road-Map
 - In the future, we can develop better model if we increase the epoch size and also if we use other deep learning algorithms we may get a better accuracy score than the current    one.
 - Database can be created to store and run the webapp. Also, we can create a website for detection of Pneumonia, so that it can be easier for even normal people to detect it      online.
 - We can use better dataset, Augumentation technique and data preprocessing, to increase the accuracy and test validation score.
